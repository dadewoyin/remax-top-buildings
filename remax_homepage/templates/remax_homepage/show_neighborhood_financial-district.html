                The Financial District is a neighborhood located at the southern tip of Manhattan, which comprises of the offices and headquarters of many major financial institutions, including the New York Stock Exchange and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.<br><br>
                Anchored by Wall Street in the Manhattan Financial District, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world, and the New York Stock Exchange is the world’s largest stock exchange by total market capitalization. Therefore, the Financial District is very powerful in the business world, and is well known for these attributes.<br><br>
                However, the Financial District also has many other characteristics that are often overlooked, such as its convenient location, large number of bars and restaurants, as well as hotels for vacationing. Even though the Financial District bars are often quiet, they make for a great venue to relax and enjoy a peaceful night by yourself or with a few friends. The large volume of workers by day have increased the demand for high-quality restaurants, which still operate in the company of other residents after the business class leaves. Therefore, Financial District makes a terrific spot to marvel at the bustle by day and peaceful venues by night.<br><br>

                In terms of real estate, towering office complexes meld with old world conversions and new luxurious residential constructions in the Financial District (FiDi). The transportation to Financial District is very convenient, as many roads and transport paths in New York City begin or end here. So, if you’re interested in a tremendous working location that also functions as an amazing neighborhood by night, check out a property in the Financial District.<br><br>
