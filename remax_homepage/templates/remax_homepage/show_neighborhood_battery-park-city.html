                One of the quietest and greenest areas of New York City, Battery Park City is perfect for a suburbian at heart to live in the city. Battery Park City is bordered by TriBeCa and Financial District.<br><br>

                As expected of a serene area of Manhattan, Battery Park City holds a large number of parks within the small neighborhood, including esplanades, Teardrop Park, and South Cove Park. Residents enjoy the large green areas throughout the neighborhood, including the many oases even decorating commercial sections. Still, there are many attractions within the area, such as fine dining on the river with views of the Statue of Liberty and New Jersey, and bars with their own uniqueness. Some very high-profile department stores are located here, in addition to the many daily errand stores, such as grocery and laundry, that are also available to the everyday resident.<br><br>

                In terms of real estate, Battery Park City lies significantly lower than the New York City average, making it an affordable option for many young residents that are looking to move to New York City without the added costs. Therefore, Battery Park City is ideal for anyone looking to make a move, so consider renting or buying a property here today!<br><br>
